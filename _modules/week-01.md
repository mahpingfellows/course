Nov 2 
: **DAY 1**{: .label .label-red} **Why do circadian rhythms matter?** 
    : [Slides](https://mahpingfellows.github.io/course/files/day1.pdf)
: **Instructors**{: .label .label-grey} Ben Finander, Lauren Miner, Jackie Lin, and Rachel Swope
: In our first session, we will establish foundational knowledge, describing the biological mechanisms by which circadian rhythms are entrained by environmental cues and synchronized throughout the body. 
: After Day 1, students will understand:
: * The autoinhibitory transcriptional network that creates circadian rhythms
: * The concept of entrainment, i.e. that external cues can be used to adjust intrinsically generated rhythms
: * How light entrains the clock
: * How peripheral clocks differ from the central circadian clock
: * That almost ALL tissues in the body (a) have circadian rhythms, and (b) rely on these rhythms to function

Nov 3
: **DAY 2**{: .label .label-red} **How can we apply circadian biology to inform decisions related to shift work?** 
    : [Slides]()
: **Instructors**{: .label .label-grey} Lucy Lai, Rachel Swope, Ben Finander, and Mikaili Abdullah
: In our second session, we will apply our knowledge of circadian biology to the health risk posed by shift work. Operating outside of a natural circadian rhythm is inherently unhealthy, but we can leverage what we know about circadian biology to protect both long-term health outcomes and performance of shift workers.
: After Day 2, students will understand:
: * The history and current state of shift work in the US
: * The broad implications of non-standard work schedules
: * How timing of meals can impact entrainment of peripheral clocks in the gut and outcomes on circadian disruption

Nov 4 
: **DAY 3**{: .label .label-red} **How can we apply circadian biology to broader policy decisions like Daylight Savings Time?** 
    : [Slides]()
: **Instructors**{: .label .label-grey} Brittany Bush, Mikaili Abdullah, and Lucy Lai

: In our third session, we will discuss how circadian biology informs general policy decisions using the examples of Daylight Savings Time and school start times. We will focus on health outcomes resulting from policy decisions.

: After Day 3, students will understand:
: * The historical origins and current implementation of Daylight Savings Time in the US
: * How shifting waking hours due to DST affects the relative risks of diseases
: * How behavioral techniques can aid in adapting to circadian disruption
: * How future policies should be informed by circadian biology
