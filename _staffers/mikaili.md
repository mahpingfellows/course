I'm a 4th year PhD student at Morehouse School of Medicine. My research revolves around the cell biology of prostate cancer. I have always had a love for teaching. As the son of parents and grandparents in higher education, I guess it was only natural. The MAPHING Pedagogy Fellows program has come along and filled an important gap in my professional journey. Following the completion of my degree, I plan on pursuing a career in science communication as well  as developing myself as a science educator in both higher education and in cyberspace.
