I'm a Lecturer on Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School and the Associate Director of the [Harvard PhD Program in Neuroscience](https://pinphd.hms.harvard.edu/). I am deeply committed to making the field of neuroscience more diverse, equitable and inclusive through educational offerings spanning multiple career stages. I co-direct the [Morehouse and Harvard Partnership in Neuroscience Growth (MAHPING)](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/mahping) initiative and the [Program in Neuroscience Post-baccalaureate program (PiNBAC)](https://pinbac.hms.harvard.edu/) at Harvard, and I teach diverse student populations spanning high school through graduate and medical students.
