I am a 5th year PhD in Biomedical Sciences and MS in Clinical Research candidate in the Department of Neurobiology at Morehouse School of Medicine. My research focuses on the relationship between sleep and the maladaptive response to social stress in amouse model. I joined the MAHPING Pedadogy Fellows because I aim to have a career in academic research and become a tenured professor.
