I am a second year PhD student in the Biological and Biomedical Sciences Program at Harvard, doing my thesis in [Chris A. Walsh's lab](https://walshlab.org/) at Boston Children's Hospital. I joined the MAHPING Pedagogy Fellows because I am interested in centering my career around science education.
