I'm a Professor of Neurobiology at Morehouse School of Medicine as well as the Director of the [MSM BS/MS Program in Neuroscience](https://www.msm.edu/Education/neurobiology/BSMSprogram/). My laboratory is focused on elucidating functional changes in signaling and circuitry in different parts of the brain as a result of normal aging, or as a result of neuropsychiatric disease such as depression or neurological disease such as epilepsy.
