I am a PhD student in the Harvard Program in Neuroscience in the lab of [Michael Crickmore](http://www.crickmorelab.org/). I use Drosophila as a model organism to study motivation. Specifically, Iâ€™m interested in how motivation arises and declines over the course of a single instance of behavior and in the long term as the animal becomes satiated after many instances of behavior.
