I'm a 5th year PhD student in the Harvard Program in Neuroscience. My research in the [Gershman lab](https://gershmanlab.com/) focuses on how humans learn and make decisions under limited cognitive resources. I love teaching and mentoring students at Harvard College as a [Resident Tutor](https://quincy.harvard.edu/people/lucy-lai) and through science outreach programs like [HPREP](https://hprep.wordpress.com/). The MAHPING Pedagogy Fellows program has been the perfect way to further my interests in collaborative teaching!
