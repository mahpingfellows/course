I'm a 5th year PhD student in the Harvard Neuroscience program. My research focuses on how humans learn and make decisions under limited cognitive resources. I love teaching and mentoring students at Harvard College and through outreach programs like [HPREP](https://hprep.wordpress.com/). The MAHPING Pedagogy Fellows program has been the perfect way to further my interests in collaborative teaching!
