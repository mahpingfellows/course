Iâ€™m a 5th year MD/PhD student (3rd year PhD student in the Department of Microbiology, Biochemistry, and Immunology) at Morehouse School of Medicine. My research investigates Staphylococcus aureus infections in children through integrating individual-level, place-based, and molecular risk factors using spatial-statistical modeling.
